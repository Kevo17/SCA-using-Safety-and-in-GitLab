<h1>SCA using Safety and in GitLab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, participants will learn how to perform Software Component Analysis (SCA) using Safety, an open-source security scanner, integrated within the GitLab CI/CD pipeline. Secure Code Analysis is a crucial step in the software development lifecycle to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities in code.
During the lab, participants will gain hands-on experience in setting up a GitLab CI/CD pipeline and configuring Safety as an automated SCA tool. They will explore the various features of Safety and understand how it can help detect common programming errors and security risks in their codebase.
